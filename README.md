# Pokedex from Pokemon!

This pokedex webpage using the public PokeAPI to load and display data about each pokemon. In its current state you can view the full list of pokemon upon first load, search for pokemon based on partial names or full names, and then click each pokemon's card to view their details. The details include their typing, a stat distribution graph just like it is displayed in the games, the abilities they can learn, and a comprehensive list of all moves they can learn (including TMs). 

## Work-In-Progress

1. Pages for each move (display move name, typing, physical/special/status, priority, power, and PP).
2. Pages for each ability (name + description should be enough. Maybe include list of pokemon it can be found on).
3. Search by pokemon generation.
